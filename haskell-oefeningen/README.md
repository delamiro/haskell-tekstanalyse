# How to run

Since these files are just singular Haskell files you can use the commando

```bash
runghc fileName.hs
```

> Note!
> ```runhaskell fileName.hs```
> is also a way to run haskell files, the difference between **runhaskell** and **runghc** is that **runghc** allows **ghc options**. These are options you can run with the run commando.
> An example is ```ghc -Werror MyFile.hs``` this treats warnings as errors.
> Run ```ghc --help``` to see more options.
