# Semi important notes

These are notes i made/make whilst researching and programming in Haskell.
I put them here because i dont know if i will need the information in the future of this project.
Better document weird findings then not.

## Guards vs If else vs case

Rule of Thumb

Use guards when conditions are inequalities or boolean expressions.

Use case when you are matching specific values.

Use if … then … else for simple inline choices.
