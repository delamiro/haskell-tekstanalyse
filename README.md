# Prerequisites

To run these files you need to install 3 things:

1. [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/)
2. [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. [VsCode Haskell extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell)

## GHCup

**GHCup** is a version manager for the Haskell toolchain. when you are installing **GHCup** you also will download:

- **GHC** Haskell compiler
- **cabal** Haskell package manager
- **Haskell Language** Server the language server for Haskell. It provides
completion, inline errors, code actions etc. in supporting editors (e. g. VSCode)

> **Important**  
> When installing you need to say you want to install all these things. So look carefull during installation!!!

## VsCode

This is the text editor that i will use. When there is a instruction on how to run a file, it will be assumed that you are using this editor.

## VsCode Haskell extension

Highlights syntax and will color your haskell code properly. This makes coding easier and more readable.
